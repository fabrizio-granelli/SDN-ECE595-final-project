# Network Slicing ECE_595_final_project.n1 
## Harsh Kumar & Sriram Thotakura

### Introduction

### Project Goal
To implement in Comnetsemu VM a network slicing strategy to adapt to emergency situation
DETAILS: typically 2 slices are available, equally sharing the total capacity(e.g. 10Mbps divided in 5Mbps+5Mbps) but using only 50% of the respective capacity; a new slice is then built for emergency communicationsâ€“requiring 4 Mbps, and then the other slices are reduced to 3+3Mbps. Once emergency is gone, capacity is back to the original
